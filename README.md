# MadGlory Organizational Framework

The following is the organizational framework we use to self-organize, grow our company,
and enjoy our work. It outlines how we work together, complete client projects,
and work towards realizing our vision.

#### Background
We started out as a very small agency, but we've quickly grown to over 30 people
and we continue to grow.  When we were small, all decisions could be made by everyone
on the team.  As we've grown, it's harder to make decisions as a group.

Happily, we've managed to build our team on talent and trust, and thus we've
decided to outline a framework by which we can continue grow, while at the same
time retaining the culture we've fought so hard to build.

# Why we exist

# How it works

#### [Partners]

Each employee at MadGlory is considered a partner and participates in the governance
process.

#### [Roles]

When each partner joins the company, they are hired for a specific role.  Over time, they
may choose to learn additional roles.  The following is a list of roles as they
are defined today:

  * Designer
  * Developer
  * Producer
  * Spokesperson

#### [Pods]

Pods are small groups of people from various roles, that self organize and work
towards a shared set of goals.

We currently use three types of pods.

**Initiative Pods** - Organized around a specific strategic initiative, initiative pods
are charged with working on large goals that advance MadGlory as an organization as
and/or the partners employed within.

**Project Pods** - These pods are organized around a specific client project.  They
exist for the life of the project, and typically disolve when the project is complete.

**Client Pods** - As an alternative to Project Pods, we sometimes use Client Pods.  We've identified
a few cases where this type of pod is more effective.
  * We are working on several concurrent projects for a single client
  * A project pod is too small to be effective
  * Multiple project pods would benefit by working closer together, sharing project and organizational knowledge.

Currently we have the following active pods[^1]:

  * Outreach
  * Creative
  * Corporate
  * Product

[^1]:
We do not list client or project pods here, due to confidentiality requirements.

#### Operational Process

Each circle uses the organizations mission, vision, and goals to define it's own
goals and performance metrics.  Pods meets regularly (needs definition), and report back to the group
periodically (needs definition).

Pods may require their own budget.

Pods may work together on some large initiatives.

Pods can be created, and destroyed based on the needs of the organization and
the interest of the partners.

#### Governance

This repository will contain all governance documents.  Changes and proposals
can be discussed, and submitted via pull-request.
